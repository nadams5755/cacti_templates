# Cacti Templates
-----------------
graph_cisco_aironet_two_radios.xml is for cisco Aironet APs.  i usually set Host Template to Cisco Router, then add this graph to an Aironet AP.

graph_two_interfaces_stacked.xml is a template I use for a device w/ more than one interface, and i want to see both interfaces overlaid.

cacti and rrdtool seem to make stacking/aggregating multiple sources into one graph.

both graphs were exported from 0.8.8b
